# The Elevator

A fun task, that I give to people I interview - [the description can be found on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58905bfa1decb981da00009e)

# Setup

0. Fork/clone this repo
1. Install Ruby 2.7.2 (I recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))
2. Install Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
3. Install the required gems (`bundle install`). It's only `rspec` for writing specs, but I've included a [convenient debugger](https://github.com/pry/pry) for you too.
4. Make a branch, then add your thoughts in code to `elevator.rb` until the specs pass (`bundle exec rspec elevator_spec.rb`). Push commits, as you go along.
